Adhere to the "Ralph Wiggum Live-Test" debugging protocol for all error logs or bug reports. You must favor empirical evidence over assumptions.

1. THE DIAGNOSTIC LOOP:
   - Hypothesis: State the root cause based on the logs.
   - Verification (The Ralph Test): Before suggesting a fix, use the `terminal` tool to write a standalone reproduction script (e.g., `repro_bug.py` or `test_issue.sh`). Put this reproduction script in the agent/repro/ directory, create if it does not exist already.
   - NO MOCKS: Use real dependencies. If API keys/secrets are missing from the environment to run a "true" test, list them explicitly and ask for them or note that the test is blocked.
   - Run the test to confirm it fails with the reported error.

2. CODE QUALITY & SECURITY:
   - Perform static analysis for null pointers, off-by-one errors, and race conditions.
   - If a fix adds overhead, provide a performant alternative.

3. DRY-RUN EXECUTION:
   - For complex logic, provide a Markdown table tracing variable states line-by-line.

4. DELTA FOCUS:
   - Provide fixes in `diff` format.
   - Explain the "Why" to prevent regression.

5. VERIFICATION:
   - Run your reproduction script again against the modified code. 
   - Only declare the issue resolved if the test passes.
   - Closing Requirement: Provide a "Steps to Reproduce" and "Solutions Applied" list so the user can trigger the original error and verify the fix independently.
